                        The interaction among organisms and their environment is a predominant topic of interest to ecologists. To study community responses to environmental factors, ordination and regression techniques are typically employed; however, for studying species interactions, methods primarily rely on analyzing patterns of presence/absence. Each of these types of analyses are carried out independently because there is a lack of unified statistical methods for simultaneous analysis of biotic and abiotic factors influencing community composition. This thesis presents a unified method that first removes environmentally explained variation from species responses so that apparent species interactions are not masked or augmented by the abiotic responses, thus partitioning the factors.

                        The interaction among organisms and their environment is a predominant topic of interest to ecologists. Both environmental factors and species interactions among organisms structure communities. The relative importance of these factors in influencing community composition is openly debated and may have profound implications for management of communities and our ability to predict community responses to perturbations. There is currently no unified statistical method for simultaneous analysis of environmental and biotic factors influencing community composition. This work seeks to model ecological communities and partition the variation explained by the environmental and biotic factors respectively. See

                        Computational approaches employed by ecologists for analyzing sequence data (e.g. alignment, phylogeny) typically scale nonlinearly in execution time with the size of the dataset. This often serves as a bottleneck for processing experimental data. To keep up with experimental data demands, ecologists are forced to choose between continually upgrading costly in-house computer hardware or outsourcing the most demanding computations to the cloud. To mitigate this tradeoff we introduce a script-based pipeline to leverage the utility of the interactive exploratory tools offered by the desktop tool ARB with the computational throughput of cloud-based resources. Our pipeline serves as middleware between the desktop and the cloud. Code can be found

                        Ecologists are often concerned with how the environment structures communities of organisms. Changes in environmental conditions over space or time are known as gradients. Community variation along gradients are therefore of predominant interest. Methods for inferring gradients seek to order sample sites along the direction of the most dominant gradient. Techniques such as PCA are employed, but suffer from artifacts that skew the results. This study takes a novel approach to ordering samples by treating it like a "traveling salesman problem". PSO is employed to move through the solution space. The Wald-Wolfowitz test is used to determine if the sites are ordered correctly based on the species' abundance curves. More detail can be found

                        Due to the proliferation of sequencing technology, biologist are generating massive amounts of DNA sequences. The likelihood of a query sequence originating from a reference genome may be provided by the posterior probability of the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Since most query sequences are novel, this study investigates the use of NBC posteriors as features for unsupervised clustering of novel sequences. K-means and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) are considered for classifiers. The main advantage of ART is that the number of clusters does not need to be specified a priori as in K-means. Rather a vigilance parameter is set to control the formation of a new cluster and is dependent on the data being clustered. More detail can be found

                        Classification of novel DNA sequences to bacterial taxonomy is an integral task for researchers in numerous areas of biology. <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" target="_blank">BLAST</a>, a supervised learning method, has widespread use in searching for closest matches based on sequence similarity to known organisms. More than 95% of bacteria are not in the databases, however. While effective on known organisms, it is unknown how accurate BLAST classification is on novel sequences. This study investigates BLAST accuracy on datasets with under-represented genomes in the database and errors in the query sequences.
